# Vertax-Cover-Problem

The project is to help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections. You will solve a particular kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in this context. The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.
